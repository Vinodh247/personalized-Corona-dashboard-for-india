# personalized-Corona-dashboard-for-india

I have created a personalized dashboard for daily update on corona cases for my country. There has been numerous agencies reporting the data claiming to be accurate but actually is not. Hence i have decided to pull the dataset from ECDC (https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en) myself and filtered out data to my requirement. This will pull the dataset and save the csv file which contains the data for all the countries in the world. After all the manipulations it will create a graph with numbers as annotations and smtp code has been included thereby the data for the last 20 days with the graph as attachment will be sent over the mail.

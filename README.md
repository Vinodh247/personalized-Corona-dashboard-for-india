# personalized-Corona-dashboard-for-india

I have created a personalized dashboard for daily update on corona cases for my country. There has been numerous agencies reporting the data claiming to be accurate but actually is not. Hence i have decided to pull the dataset from ECDC (https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en) myself and filtered out data to my requirement.
